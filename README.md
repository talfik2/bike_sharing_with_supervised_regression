# bike_sharing_with_supervised_regression
    In this repo, I applied Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest, Gredient Boosting, and Ensemble Learning algorithms to their capabilities for predicting total number of bike rentals from the bike sharing systems dataset.

    Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
    I evaluated these model's by Mean Squared Error & Root Mean Squared Error.
    
    I also detected best hyperparameters for these models by Hyperparameter Tuning Method.
